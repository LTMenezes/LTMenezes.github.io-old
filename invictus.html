				<h3>
				Out of the night that covers me, 
					  Black as the pit from pole to pole, 
				I thank whatever gods may be 
					  For my unconquerable soul. 
				</h3>
				<h3>
				In the fell clutch of circumstance 
					  I have not winced nor cried aloud. 
				Under the bludgeonings of chance 
					  My head is bloody, but unbowed. 
				</h3>
				<h3>
				Beyond this place of wrath and tears 
					  Looms but the Horror of the shade, 
				And yet the menace of the years 
					  Finds and shall find me unafraid. 
				</h3>
				<h3>
				It matters not how strait the gate, 
					  How charged with punishments the scroll, 
				I am the master of my fate, 
					  I am the captain of my soul. 
				</h3>
